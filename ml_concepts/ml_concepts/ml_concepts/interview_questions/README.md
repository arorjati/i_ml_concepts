## Usage

Each interview question is implemented as a method that returns a dictionary containing:

- The question text
- A detailed markdown-formatted answer
- Key points to remember
- Visual aids (matplotlib figures)
- Code examples
- References to additional resources

Example usage:

```python
from ml_concepts.interview_questions.basics.fundamentals import MLFundamentals

# Get the bias-variance tradeoff question and answer
question_data = MLFundamentals.bias_variance_tradeoff()

# Access components
print(question_data["question"])  # Print the question
print(question_data["answer"])    # Print the detailed answer
print(question_data["key_points"])  # Print bullet points of key concepts

# Display visualizations
for fig in question_data["figures"]:
    fig.show()
    
# You can also access examples if provided
if "examples" in question_data:
    print(question_data["examples"])
```

## Features

- **Visual Explanations**: Complex concepts are explained with intuitive visualizations.
- **Markdown Formatting**: Answers are formatted with markdown for easy reading.
- **Mathematical Rigor**: Includes proper mathematical notation and explanations.
- **Practical Examples**: Code snippets demonstrate how concepts apply in practice.
- **Key Takeaways**: Bulleted lists of the most important points to remember.

## Contributing New Questions

To add a new interview question:

1. Identify the appropriate category folder
2. Create or update a Python file with a meaningful name
3. Implement your question as a static method that returns a dictionary with the standard fields
4. Include visualizations where helpful
5. Add the question to the appropriate section in this README
