## 1. Data Science

**Q1: How do you handle missing data? What are the pros and cons of different methods?**
**A:**
* **Deletion:** Remove rows/columns with missing values.
    * *Pros:* Simple.
    * *Cons:* Can lose significant data, introduce bias if data is not missing completely at random (MCAR).
* **Imputation (Mean/Median/Mode):** Replace missing values with the mean, median, or mode of the column.
    * *Pros:* Simple, retains data size.
    * *Cons:* Reduces variance, distorts relationships between variables, doesn't account for uncertainty.
* **Regression Imputation:** Predict missing values using regression models based on other features.
    * *Pros:* Can be more accurate, preserves relationships.
    * *Cons:* Computationally more expensive, relies on model assumptions.
* **Multiple Imputation (e.g., MICE):** Create multiple complete datasets with different imputed values and pool results.
    * *Pros:* Accounts for imputation uncertainty, generally provides less biased estimates.
    * *Cons:* Complex to implement and interpret.
* **Using Algorithms that Handle Missing Data:** Some algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) can handle missing values internally.
    * *Pros:* Convenient.
    * *Cons:* Handling method might not be optimal for the specific dataset.

**Q2: Explain dimensionality reduction. Why is it used, and what are some common techniques?**
**A:** Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features (variables) in a dataset while preserving as much important information as possible.
* **Why use it?**
    * Reduce computational cost and training time.
    * Mitigate the "curse of dimensionality."
    * Improve model performance by removing noise and redundant features.
    * Enable data visualization (reducing to 2 or 3 dimensions).
* **Techniques:**
    * **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Unsupervised linear technique that finds principal components (linear combinations of original features) that capture maximum variance.
    * **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA):** Supervised linear technique that maximizes class separability.
    * **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE):** Non-linear technique primarily used for visualization, good at capturing local structure.
    * **Autoencoders:** Neural network-based approach that learns a compressed representation (encoding) of the data.
    * **Feature Selection:** Methods like filter (e.g., correlation), wrapper (e.g., recursive feature elimination), and embedded (e.g., LASSO) methods select a subset of original features.

**Q3: How would you design an A/B test for a new feature on Amazon.com?**
**A:**
1.  **Define Goal & Hypothesis:** Clearly state the objective (e.g., increase click-through rate (CTR) on recommended items) and formulate a testable hypothesis (e.g., "The new recommendation algorithm (B) will have a higher CTR than the current algorithm (A)").
2.  **Choose Metrics:** Select primary (e.g., CTR) and secondary metrics (e.g., conversion rate, add-to-cart rate, revenue per visitor, latency). Include guardrail metrics (metrics you don't want to harm).
3.  **Determine Sample Size & Duration:** Calculate the required sample size based on baseline conversion rate, desired minimum detectable effect, statistical significance level (alpha, e.g., 0.05), and statistical power (beta, e.g., 0.8). Estimate the test duration based on traffic.
4.  **Randomization Unit:** Decide the unit of randomization (e.g., user ID, session ID, cookie). Ensure users consistently see the same version.
5.  **Implementation:** Randomly assign users to control (A) and treatment (B) groups. Implement the feature for group B.
6.  **Monitoring:** Monitor the test in real-time for significant negative impacts or bugs.
7.  **Analysis:** After the test duration, analyze the results using appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-test, Z-test, Chi-squared test) to determine if the difference in metrics is statistically significant.
8.  **Conclusion & Decision:** Based on the analysis, decide whether to launch the new feature, iterate, or discard it. Consider practical significance alongside statistical significance.

## 2. Machine Learning

**Q1: Explain the bias-variance tradeoff.**
**A:** The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in supervised learning.
* **Bias:** Error introduced by approximating a real-world problem (which may be complex) by a too-simple model. High bias models underfit the data (e.g., linear regression on non-linear data).
* **Variance:** Error introduced because of the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data. High variance models overfit the data, capturing noise (e.g., a complex decision tree).
* **Tradeoff:** Increasing model complexity typically decreases bias but increases variance. Decreasing complexity increases bias but decreases variance. The goal is to find a sweet spot that minimizes the total error (Bias^2 + Variance + Irreducible Error) on unseen data. Techniques like cross-validation, regularization (L1/L2), and ensemble methods (bagging reduces variance, boosting reduces bias) help manage this tradeoff.

**Q2: Describe the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning. Give examples.**
**A:**
* **Supervised Learning:** The algorithm learns from a labeled dataset, meaning each data point has an associated output or target variable. The goal is to learn a mapping function from inputs to outputs.
    * *Examples:* Linear Regression (predicting house prices), Logistic Regression (spam detection), Support Vector Machines (image classification), Decision Trees.
* **Unsupervised Learning:** The algorithm learns from an unlabeled dataset, identifying patterns, structures, or relationships within the data without predefined outputs.
    * *Examples:* K-Means Clustering (customer segmentation), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (dimensionality reduction), Association Rule Mining (market basket analysis).

**Q3: What are precision and recall? When would you prioritize one over the other?**
**A:** Precision and recall are evaluation metrics for classification tasks, especially useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.
* **Precision:** Of all instances the model predicted as positive, what fraction were actually positive? `Precision = TP / (TP + FP)` (TP=True Positives, FP=False Positives). High precision means few false positives.
* **Recall (Sensitivity):** Of all actual positive instances, what fraction did the model correctly predict as positive? `Recall = TP / (TP + FN)` (FN=False Negatives). High recall means few false negatives.
* **Prioritization:**
    * **Prioritize Precision:** When the cost of False Positives is high (e.g., spam detection - you don't want to classify important emails as spam; recommendation systems - recommending irrelevant items annoys users).
    * **Prioritize Recall:** When the cost of False Negatives is high (e.g., medical diagnosis for a serious disease - you don't want to miss diagnosing someone who actually has the disease; fraud detection - you don't want to miss fraudulent transactions).
* **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall (`2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)`), useful when you need a balance between the two.

**Q4: Explain how a Random Forest works.**
**A:** Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
1.  **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):** It creates multiple bootstrap samples (random samples with replacement) from the original training data.
2.  **Feature Randomness:** For each bootstrap sample, it builds a decision tree. However, at each node split, it considers only a random subset of features (instead of all features) to find the best split. This decorrelates the trees.
3.  **Aggregation:** For classification, the final prediction is determined by majority voting among all trees. For regression, it's the average of the predictions from all trees.
* **Benefits:** Reduces overfitting (compared to single decision trees) due to bagging and feature randomness, generally high accuracy, robust to outliers, handles high-dimensional data well.

**Q5: What is overfitting, and how can you prevent it?**
**A:** Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, including noise and random fluctuations, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data. The model has high variance.
* **Prevention Techniques:**
    * **Cross-Validation:** Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance on unseen parts of the data during training.
    * **Regularization:** Add a penalty term to the loss function for large coefficient values (L1/Lasso, L2/Ridge).
    * **Simplify the Model:** Use a less complex model (e.g., fewer layers/neurons in a neural network, smaller depth in decision trees).
    * **Early Stopping:** Stop training when performance on a validation set starts to degrade.
    * **Feature Selection:** Remove irrelevant or redundant features.
    * **Get More Data:** A larger training dataset can help the model generalize better.
    * **Ensemble Methods:** Techniques like Random Forests (bagging) inherently reduce overfitting.
    * **Data Augmentation:** Artificially increase the size of the training data (common in image processing).
    * **Dropout (for Neural Networks):** Randomly drop units (along with their connections) during training.

## 3. Statistics

**Q1: Explain p-value and statistical significance.**
**A:**
* **p-value:** In hypothesis testing, the p-value is the probability of observing test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value suggests that the observed data is unlikely under the null hypothesis.
* **Statistical Significance:** We typically set a significance level (alpha, often 0.05). If the p-value is less than alpha (p < α), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the result is statistically significant. This means the observed effect is unlikely to be due to random chance alone. It does *not* necessarily mean the effect is large or practically important.

**Q2: What is the difference between Type I and Type II errors?**
**A:** In hypothesis testing:
* **Type I Error (False Positive):** Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. The probability of a Type I error is denoted by alpha (α), the significance level.
* **Type II Error (False Negative):** Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false. The probability of a Type II error is denoted by beta (β). Power (1 - β) is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis.
* **Tradeoff:** Decreasing the probability of one type of error typically increases the probability of the other for a fixed sample size.

**Q3: Explain Confidence Intervals.**
**A:** A confidence interval (CI) provides a range of plausible values for an unknown population parameter (e.g., mean, proportion) based on sample data. A 95% confidence interval means that if we were to repeat the sampling process many times and construct a CI for each sample, about 95% of those intervals would contain the true population parameter. It quantifies the uncertainty associated with the sample estimate. The width of the CI depends on the sample size, the variability of the data, and the desired confidence level.

**Q4: When would you use a t-test vs. a Z-test?**
**A:** Both tests are used to compare means, but the choice depends on sample size and knowledge of the population standard deviation (σ).
* **Z-test:** Used when the population standard deviation (σ) is known, *or* when the sample size is large (typically n > 30), allowing the sample standard deviation (s) to be a good estimate of σ due to the Central Limit Theorem.
* **t-test:** Used when the population standard deviation (σ) is unknown *and* the sample size is small (typically n < 30). It uses the sample standard deviation (s) and the t-distribution, which accounts for the additional uncertainty introduced by estimating σ from the sample.

## 4. Probability

**Q1: Explain Bayes' Theorem.**
**A:** Bayes' Theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event. It allows updating beliefs (probabilities) in light of new evidence.
`P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)`
Where:
* `P(A|B)`: Posterior probability - Probability of hypothesis A given evidence B.
* `P(B|A)`: Likelihood - Probability of evidence B given hypothesis A is true.
* `P(A)`: Prior probability - Initial probability of hypothesis A before observing evidence B.
* `P(B)`: Marginal probability - Probability of evidence B.
It's fundamental in areas like Bayesian inference, spam filtering, and medical diagnosis.

**Q2: What is the difference between permutations and combinations?**
**A:** Both relate to selecting items from a set, but the difference lies in whether the order of selection matters.
* **Permutations:** Order matters. It's the number of ways to arrange 'k' items from a set of 'n' distinct items. Formula: `P(n, k) = n! / (n-k)!`
* **Combinations:** Order does *not* matter. It's the number of ways to choose 'k' items from a set of 'n' distinct items, irrespective of the order. Formula: `C(n, k) = n! / [k! * (n-k)!]`

**Q3: Explain Conditional Probability.**
**A:** Conditional probability is the probability of an event (A) occurring given that another event (B) has already occurred. It is denoted as `P(A|B)`.
Formula: `P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)`, where `P(B) > 0`.
`P(A ∩ B)` is the probability that both events A and B occur.

## 5. Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

**Q1: Describe the difference between an array and a linked list.**
**A:**
* **Array:**
    * *Structure:* Contiguous block of memory.
    * *Access:* O(1) time complexity for access by index.
    * *Insertion/Deletion:* O(n) time complexity in the worst/average case (requires shifting elements), O(1) at the end if space is available.
    * *Memory:* Fixed size (static arrays) or dynamic but potentially requires reallocation.
* **Linked List:**
    * *Structure:* Nodes containing data and pointers to the next node(s); nodes can be scattered in memory.
    * *Access:* O(n) time complexity for access by index (requires traversal).
    * *Insertion/Deletion:* O(1) time complexity if the node (or previous node) is known, O(n) to find the node first.
    * *Memory:* Dynamic size, grows as needed.

**Q2: What is a hash table (or hash map)? How does it work, and what are collisions?**
**A:**
* **Hash Table:** A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. It uses a hash function to compute an index (or "bucket") into an array from which the desired value can be found.
* **How it works:**
    1.  A key is passed to a hash function.
    2.  The hash function computes an integer hash code.
    3.  This hash code is mapped to an index in the underlying array.
    4.  The key-value pair is stored at that index.
* **Collisions:** Occur when the hash function generates the same index for two or more different keys.
* **Collision Resolution Techniques:**
    * **Separate Chaining:** Each bucket stores a pointer to a linked list (or other data structure) containing all key-value pairs that hash to that index.
    * **Open Addressing (e.g., Linear Probing, Quadratic Probing, Double Hashing):** If a collision occurs, probe for the next available slot in the array according to a specific rule.
* **Complexity:** Average time complexity for search, insert, and delete is O(1), assuming a good hash function and effective collision resolution. Worst-case is O(n) if all keys hash to the same bucket.

**Q3: Explain Big O notation.**
**A:** Big O notation is used in computer science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It characterizes the worst-case scenario, focusing on how the runtime or space requirements grow as the input size (n) increases. It describes the upper bound of the growth rate.
* *Examples:*
    * `O(1)`: Constant time (e.g., accessing an array element by index).
    * `O(log n)`: Logarithmic time (e.g., binary search).
    * `O(n)`: Linear time (e.g., searching an unsorted list).
    * `O(n log n)`: Log-linear time (e.g., efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, Heap Sort).
    * `O(n^2)`: Quadratic time (e.g., bubble sort, comparing every pair in a list).
    * `O(2^n)`: Exponential time (e.g., finding all subsets of a set).
    * `O(n!)`: Factorial time (e.g., generating all permutations of a list).

**Q4: When would you use Breadth-First Search (BFS) vs. Depth-First Search (DFS)?**
**A:** Both are graph traversal algorithms.
* **BFS:**
    * *Method:* Explores neighbor nodes first before moving to the next level neighbors (level by level). Uses a queue.
    * *Use Cases:* Finding the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph, finding connected components, level order traversal of a tree.
* **DFS:**
    * *Method:* Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Uses a stack (often implicitly via recursion).
    * *Use Cases:* Detecting cycles in a graph, topological sorting, finding connected components, solving puzzles with constraints (like mazes).

## 6. Software Design

**Q1: What are the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP)?**
**A:**
* **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit (class). Restricting direct access to some components (using access modifiers like private/protected).
* **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential features or interfaces to the user.
* **Inheritance:** Mechanism where a new class (subclass/derived class) inherits properties and methods from an existing class (superclass/base class). Promotes code reuse.
* **Polymorphism:** Ability of an object to take on many forms. Allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon (e.g., method overriding, method overloading).

**Q2: Imagine you need to design a system to process and analyze large volumes of clickstream data in near real-time. What components would you consider?**
**A:** (High-level design)
1.  **Data Ingestion:** A scalable layer to receive click events (e.g., Kafka, AWS Kinesis, Google Pub/Sub). Needs to handle high throughput.
2.  **Data Processing:** A stream processing engine (e.g., Apache Flink, Apache Spark Streaming, AWS Kinesis Data Analytics, Google Dataflow) to process data in near real-time (filtering, aggregation, enrichment).
3.  **Data Storage:**
    * *Raw Data:* Store raw events in a cost-effective, durable storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
    * *Processed/Aggregated Data:* Store results in a low-latency database suitable for querying (e.g., NoSQL like DynamoDB/Cassandra for key-value lookups, or a data warehouse like Redshift/BigQuery for analytical queries).
    * *Real-time Dashboard Store:* Potentially a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus) or a fast cache (e.g., Redis) for powering dashboards.
4.  **Analysis/Querying Layer:** Tools or APIs to query the processed data for insights or to feed into ML models.
5.  **Monitoring & Alerting:** Track system health, data quality, and processing latency.
6.  **Scalability & Reliability:** Design components to be horizontally scalable and fault-tolerant.

**Q3: What is an API? What makes a good API design?**
**A:** An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. It specifies how different software components should interact.
* **Good API Design Principles:**
    * **Simplicity & Ease of Use:** Intuitive, easy to learn and use.
    * **Consistency:** Follows predictable patterns and naming conventions.
    * **Discoverability:** Easy for developers to understand its capabilities (good documentation, self-descriptive).
    * **Reliability & Performance:** Performs well under load and handles errors gracefully.
    * **Good Documentation:** Clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date documentation with examples.
    * **Appropriate Abstraction:** Hides underlying complexity but provides necessary control.
    * **Security:** Implements proper authentication and authorization.
    * **Versioning:** Allows for evolution without breaking existing clients.
